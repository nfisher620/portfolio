    <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/me.jpg">
    <p>My name is Nicole and I was born and raised in Orange County, California. I graduated from the University of
        California at Davis in 2011 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Managerial Economics. In June 2015, I received
        a Business Analyst certificate from the University of California at Irvine. I am the youngest daughter of a
        family of four. My older sister and my parents mean the world to me and have made me the person I
        am today. I recently married the love of my life, Ben, this past summer in San Clemente. My favorite things to
        do are spend time with my husband and family, go to Disneyland, and bake desserts. </p>
    <p>As a teaching assistant at UC Davis for a course in "Technology in Computers", I was first introduced to coding.
        The program that we used was SeaMonkey Composer, a user friendly HTML editor. We used this program to create a
        personal website for each student. After graduating college, coding came back into my life after my sister went
        to Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco. She has inspired me to become a developer and I'm so excited to be following
        in her footsteps.</p>
    <p>After graduating from LearningFuze, I am looking to working for a company where I can use my talents and skills
        to grow and expand the company. I am confident with my hard work, dedication, and tenacity that I will be a
        great asset to any company. I'm hungry to get my career as a developer started!</p>
